these env files were exported and can in principle be used to build conda env, but provided that the
packages at the specified versions are still available

the installation was actually done without specifying exact versions


to avoid accidentally putting stuff into the root conda env, the miniconda directory is 
recursively made read-only and then write permission added to only the envs/ and pkg/ 
subdirectories (and their contents)


CMOR:
install miniconda3 and add the bin directory to path
then
conda create -n qc
source activate qc
conda install -c pcmdi cmor


esgprep:
install miniconda2 and add the bin directory to path
then
conda create -n esgprep
source activate esgprep
conda install pip python=2.7
pip install esgprep

(the conda install pip is because otherwise the pip install finds pip only in the
base conda env + tries to pip install esgprep there)
